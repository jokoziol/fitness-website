            <p class="content">Security and privacy have a high priority. That's why everything is stored in encrypted form.<br>
            The private key that is generated each time the app is re-installed or reset is stored in the in the Secure Enclave.
            The Secure Enclave provides more hardware security because the chip is isolated from the main processor.
            If the main processor has been compromised, the private key will not be released by the Secure Enclave.<br>
            In addition, a passcode must have been added to unlock the device.
            This additionally encrypts some data with the device passcode.
            If the passcode is removed, all the data will be deleted.
            </p>
            <p class="content">The app offers over 20 workouts (e.g. cycling, hiking, boxing).
            By using geo-fencing, areas can be saved where a workout should be end.
            If you start a workout on your doorstep and want it to stop when you arrive at home, you can easily set this up through the app.<br>
            It is also possible to set quick starts. This allows you to quickly start a workout without having to search for the workout beforehand.
